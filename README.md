# pfSense-home-network
This project has been on the list for awhile! I've been waiting patiently until I got my hands on a desktop that I can turn into a router/ firewall using pfSense. 

My goals:
* Create my own personal network within my home to seclude me from the rest of the house. 
* Run a SIEM tool to gather logs, and MORE!
