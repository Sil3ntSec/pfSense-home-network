# **This will include the installation of pfSense on a physical box**
Tools used: Rufus-3.8, pfSense-2.4.4

- [ ] Step 1: Configure a USB device with pfSense
The pfSense image must be the memstick version, along with the .img.gz file type as shown: **pfSense-CE-memstick-2.4.4-RELEASE-amd64.img.gz**. Use link: https://www.pfsense.org/download/

Next, you will have to create a bootable USB drive with this pfSense image. I personally like Rufus. Use link: https://rufus.ie/
